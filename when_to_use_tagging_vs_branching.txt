A branch is used if you have 2 different versions of repository at the same time. A tag is a way to mark a point in time in your repository.

You should add a tag to mark a released version. If you then need to make bug fixes to that release you would create a branch at the tag.

You only want to delete branches that have been merged back into the HEAD [or some other branch]
